# Collapsible Panels in VB.NET
<h2>Introduction</h2> `#0969DA`

> I needed to display multiple panels with related but discrete functionality on a single form. Individually, each panel would contain different controls, yet, every panel would relate to the larger scope of the form. Since each panel would take various amounts of space to display, I would be limited to the number of panels I could display on a single form without the form becoming too busy and confusing. That is, unless the panels could collapse to a minimize size and re-expand to their normal size. I needed panel controls that could collapse and expand.
